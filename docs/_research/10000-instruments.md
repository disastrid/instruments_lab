>***The 10.000 Instruments workshop aims to cheer up social distancing through some playful interactions. We invite the NIME community to dive in an online gathering to collaborativelly sketch as many instrument ideas as possible.***

>***A lighthearted activity that might ease for a couple of hours the challenging situations we are all experiencing.***

>***An opportunity to experiment with alternative ways to generate interface ideas and speculate on music tech through open-ended artefacts and playful design explorations.***

>***An original and unconventional workshop to advance the debate around the complex, interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of contemporary musical instruments.***

##### Play Make Believe: Exploring Alternatives

This speculative virtual workshop attempts to engage with critical NIME discourse through creative and collaborative design explorations. The workshop draws on a small but growing body of work that challenges technology ideation and development through absurd, speculative and playful artefacts. These include the work of Kristina Andersen on the Magic Machine workshops and John Bowers and Owen Green which exploited the notion of hijacking as a way to question existing music technologies. Another example is of such approach is the Absurd Music Hackathon held at Queen Mary University in which the making of intentionally silly, absurd and provocative instruments allowed participants to generate a critique of current technology and illustrate future musical visions.

##### Critical Discourse & NIME Design

The workshop aims to generate critical discussions on new musical interfaces through playful devices such as absurdity, magic and make-believe. The activity will be an opportunity to create reflections that would be difficult to earn with more traditional methods, while avoiding overly theoretical and formal discussions. By moving away from classical design methods and looking at more subversive approaches we hope to question both our own practice and the routines we sometimes encounter in academic and research areas. The aim is to question the role of technology in creative practice through make-believe, fragile and contradictory artefacts and playful design explorations. By making and sharing imaginary musical instruments we aim to expand on how can absurdity and humour be helpful to stretch and critique conventional ideas of what is useful, appropriate and sensible in (music) technology research and development.

#####10.000 Instruments

The workshop features a set of permissive workspaces where it is possible to collaborate on a variety of projects - including seriously silly concepts and unworkable designs. Participants are encouraged to come and go, diverge from assumptions, follow their intuitions and play with both humour and risky ideas.

Given the constraints/opportunities of this NIME edition we have to make available communication technologies part of the game. Rather than look for the most efficient tool, we would embrace the glitches and limitations of current remote and collaborative technologies. Latency, jitter, feedback, half-duplex might then become an absurd source of inspiration. By relaying ideas through different, partially broken, modes of communication, we thus allow the network to have some agency in how exquisite musical ideas play out.

One of the workshop’s outcome will be a public document which collects participants’ contributions, impressions and takes based on their annotations, sketches, pictures and videos. These materials might than contribute to the debate around critical instrument design practices as a shared archival knowledge available to future NIME communities.

Let’s make some soup

Serves: 25ish?
Time: 2h?
Tools:

-        Workspace 1 – here is where we collect instruments concepts and ideas as plain text and hyperlinks
-        Workspace 2 – we gather here instruments mock-ups and craft interactions as audio, videos and images
-        Workspace 3 – a place for sharing some unworkable code
-        Workspace 4 – overall documentation?

Ingredients (just enough):

-        Found materials[i]
-        Light Touch
-        Collective Exploration
-        Come and Go
-        Trust and Intuition
-        Humour and Risk
-        Multiplicity and Divergence
-        No need for closure
-        Yes, and …
