How do you read (me)?

We are going through some challenging times. All around the globe we see people reaching out to each other, practicing in small and often imaginative human gestures of everyday solidarity, across balconies, networks, cities and countries.

The 10.000 Instruments workshop is another attempt to cheer up social distancing through some playful interactions. We invite the NIME community to take part in an absurd workshop in which the main rule of engagement is to come up with as many instrument ideas as possible.

The workshop features a set of permissive workspaces where it is possible to collaborate on a variety of projects - including seriously silly concepts and unworkable designs. Participants are encouraged to come and go, diverge from assumptions, follow their intuitions and play with both humour and risky ideas.

Given the constraints/opportunities of this NIME edition we have to make available communication technologies part of the game. Rather than look for the most efficient tool, we would embrace the glitches and limitations of current remote and collaborative technologies. Latency, jitter, feedback, half-duplex might then become an absurd source of inspiration. By relaying ideas through different, partially broken, modes of communication, we thus allow the network to have some agency in how exquisite musical ideas play out.


Let’s make some soup

Serves: 25ish?
Time: 2h?
Tools:

-        Workspace 1 – here is where we collect instruments concepts and ideas as plain text and hyperlinks
-        Workspace 2 – we gather here instruments mock-ups and craft interactions as audio, videos and images
-        Workspace 3 – a place for sharing some unworkable code
-        Workspace 4 – overall documentation?

Ingredients (just enough):

-        Found materials[i]
-        Light Touch
-        Collective Exploration
-        Come and Go
-        Trust and Intuition
-        Humour and Risk
-        Multiplicity and Divergence
-        No need for closure
-        Yes, and …

How can absurdity and humour be helpful to stretch and critique conventional ideas of what is useful, appropriate and sensible in (music) technology research and development?
How can the exploration of make-believe, fragile and contradictory artefacts convey future visions beyond the paradigms imposed by current music tools?
How can we question the role of technology in creative practice through embodied practices such as play and making?

##### Critical Discourse & NIME Design

We propose an original and unconventional workshop approach to advance the debate around the complex, interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of contemporary musical instruments. This activity is based on a speculative instrument craft workshop that attempts to engage with critical discourse through practical and creative design explorations.

While making musical interfaces, NIME practitioners draw influence from many diverse disciplines, skills and aesthetic perspectives. New musical artefacts and interactions are shaped by cultural values as much as research concerns and methods. The NIME community embraces a broad range of ''ways of knowing'', and researchers are often engaged with an inclusive and critical discussion of technology. We propose a workshop based on hands-on making of unconventional artefacts to advance the debate around the complex and versatile nature of contemporary musical instruments. Our proposal exploits design fiction and absurd making to engage with critical NIME discourses and practices. We aim to question the role of technology in creative practice through make-believe, fragile and contradictory artefacts and playful design explorations.

The workshop aims to generate critical discussions on new musical interfaces through playful devices such as absurdity, magic and make-believe3. Our conviction is that through the combination of play and making it will be possible to create reflections that would be difficult to earn with more traditional methods, while avoiding overly theoretical and formal discussions. The exchange of concepts and ideas will be therefore facilitated by actual artefacts that, even if non-functional, can be first physically experienced and then critically discussed.

##### Play Make Believe

By moving away from classical design methods and looking at more subversive approaches we hope to question both our own practice and the routines we sometimes encounter in academic and research areas. The designed artefacts and the considerations around them might then contribute to generate guidelines, methodological intuitions or critical statements to be shared with broader design domains. However, we propose this activity also as a way to generate critical/dissident outcome that might not necessary answers the questions previously sketched but rather leave space for open discussions and eventually create more questions related to critical approaches to NIME practices. One of the workshop’s outcome will be a public document which collects participants’ contributions, impressions and takes based on their annotations, sketches, pictures and videos. These materials might than contribute to the debate around critical instrument design practices as a shared archival knowledge available to future NIME communities.
