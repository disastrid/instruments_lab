The health, social and psychological benefits of music making have long been recognised, and well researched in the fields of music therapy, neuroscience, psychology, sociology and other disciplines.
For disabled people, there is a lack of access to music making that often prevents them from a full participation in music performance.
There exist a number of musical instruments designed specifically to accommodate the access needs of disabled people, referred to here as 'Accessible Instruments'.
Jacob Harrison's PhD research at the Augmented Instruments Lab is focused on the design of new accessible instruments, and aiming to understand ways in which instrument design can play a role in enabling full access to musical performance for disabled people.

Within the contexts of academia, commercial products and DIY projects, there exist a vast range of approaches to accessible instrument design.

Violin gesture analysis is an active area of study in many research groups. This project aims to capture the nuances of violin performance through a sensor-augmented instrument, with particular emphases on low-latency, economical, portable and non-intrusive setup and applications to new forms of expression in live performance. Left-hand finger locations on each string are measured by resistive material on the fingerboard. A new method of bow position and pressure tracking has been developed based on low-cost optical reflectance sensors. One eventual aim is to produce a new expressive interface using expert violin technique to control other sound sources.
