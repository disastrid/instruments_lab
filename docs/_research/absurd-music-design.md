##### 22-23 November 2019 / Queen Mary University of London

***Musicians, artists, technologists and designers are invited to take part to a music design workshop around the themes of absurd musical interfaces, questionable sonic interactions and unworkable music designs.***

- ***Application Deadline: September 25 - submit to g(dot)lepri(at)qmul(dot)ac(dot)uk***

The event is part of Inter/sections 2019 and it will be held at QMUL over two days. Interested candidates will be required to submit a short document proposal (max one page) outlining an unusless music design to be developed during the hack lab. Proposals should also include a short summary of candidates’ musical/artistic background and technical skills (max 200 words).

Workshop proposals would be selected by a small committee of external reviewers in  organising committee. Already existing designs and projects might be accepted only if significant “advancements” will be outlined in the submitted proposal.

The selection criteria include:

- quality of the idea: originality, silliness, unuselessness, style and achievability
- candidates background (aiming to balance a multidisciplinary convergence of people)
- age: 18 +

The following approaches are suggested (but not required) for the proposal of absurd musical interfaces:

- overly complicated musical machines
- musical interfaces that while solving a problem create a new (bigger) problem
- seriously silly sonic interaction designs
- hijacking, rejecting or subverting existing musical applications
- counterintuitive or anti-ergonomic musical tools
- artificial stupidity for musical interactions
- fictional media archaeology: musical futures that did not happened
- almost completely useless interfaces for music performance
- musical interventions beyond realistic technological premises

Group submissions focusing on the realisation of a single musical design are welcomed. In particular, teams characterised by strong multidisciplinary skills and backgrounds will be encouraged to apply. Once accepted, during the workshop candidates should address the submitted design idea, however individuals might join other accepted projects.

Two invited artists with significant experience in music technology will be on site during the workshop in order to support and challenge participants: ***Pinco & Pallino***

#### Workshop structure and resources

The project is to create absurd musical propositions using a constrained set of tools and materials. The event could be held at Queen Mary using the Media & Art Technology facilities. The tools provided to the participants would include:

- digital fabrication tools (2D design tools - laser cutter)
- traditional workshop tools
- Bela Mini - one per accepted project (to be returned at the end of the workshop)
- basic circuitry and sensors

The following materials will be provided

- basic laser cutter materials (i.e. MDF, acrylic, cardboard)
- textile materials (conductive wires, fabrics, leather)

If needed, participants will be encouraged to bring any particular tools or materials (previous communication with the organising committee) and use any free or open-source resource (e.g. programming languages such as Pure Data, Supercollider, Processing, etc). During the workshop, the organising committee (MAT and Bela members) will coordinate and facilitate the various activities. Below is a first draft of the workshop schedule (to be discussed) – proposed dates: November 2019, Friday 15th and Saturday16th or Friday 22nd and Saturday 23rd (to be discussed).

#### Nonsense as a critical framework for design

There is a long tradition in design of making provocative proposals and objects. A well-known reference of absurd design ideas is Jaques Carelman‘s Objets Introuvable (unfindable objects) which include the teapot with the handle on the same side as the spout which has illustrated the front cover of many editions of Don Norman‘s Psychology of Everyday Things.

The Italian Anti Design and Radical Design are often mentioned as early movements aiming to subvert the way people thought about objects. Anti-Design artefacts were often tools of social criticism: challenging designs that, by exploiting tools such as kitsch, irony and distortion, would encourage people to think about objects’ purposes and functionalities.

The discipline of imagining and building illogical, silly and overcomplicated machines has been practiced by both artists and inventors (see Rube Goldberg, Heath Robinson and Rowland Emett to name a few). Within the western culture, these design hazards clearly pay a tribute to Dada and Surrealist movement(s).

Another example of such practices is the Japanese art of Chindogu, where a designer produce “un-useless” objects. Unlike other absurd designs Chindogu must exist (i.e. a concept should be translated into an artefact) and they must be, from a practical point of view, (almost) completely useless. Often Chindogu solve one problem while creating other, larger problems. In this sense the design is not useless, but neither is it useful: it is “un-useless”.

#### Silly, playful and subversive musical interfaces

Within the domain of HCI and musical interaction, it is possible to identify a small but growing body of work that challenges technology ideation and development through absurd and playful artefacts. These include the work of Kristina Andersen on the Magic Machine workshops in which the making of silly fictional instruments allows participants to generate design ideas that are beyond the paradigms imposed by current music tools.

John Bowers and Owen Green instead exploited the notion of “hijacking” as a way to question existing music technologies, their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality codified into the artefacts. As a means to critically engage with current machine listening techniques, Bowers and Green build provocative music designs such as disagreeing pitch trackers, re-de-reverberators and eternal resonance machines. These were collected in the form of annotated portfolio to outline the critiques and upshots emerging while designing and using the various makings.

The workshop will offer a valuable framework for critical discussions on the use and development of musical interfaces, sonic interaction paradigms and design tools. This will be facilitated by playful and insightful devices such as irony, paradox, contradiction and nonsense. While revealing musical values and technological assumptions it will be possible to open up design spaces which might be unlikely to be explored with more traditional HCI perspectives.
