***Artists, technologists and makers took part in a hackathon around the themes of absurd musical interfaces, questionable sonic interactions and unworkable music designs.***

>**On the wake of the [Stupid Hackathons](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), see the [Absurd Music Hackathon Call](http://instrumentslab.org/news/events/2019/08/08/absurd-november-2019.html)**

The event was part of [Inter/sections](https://intersections.io/) 2019 supported by the [Media and Arts Technology](http://www.mat.qmul.ac.uk/) (MAT) doctoral training centre - Queen Mary University of London.

##### Useless (but not worthless) music designs

**Andrea Urist**

Andrea worked out a beautiful overly complicated sonic machine: grab this stuffed fluffy thing to get a sound back! Repurposing a vintage toy crane motor in a silly sonic experience. This unsuseless design plays with arcade games esthetic and expectations: here it is almost impossible not to win!

**Maria Svahn, Josefine Holling & Annie Tadne**

{% include youtube.html youtube="LICKTXX09E" %}

Introducing the Bug Orchestra. A fully equipped facility to elicit animals' musical creativity (including red carpet, dance floor and rave area). An artistic residency in which a small ensemble of robotic bugs compose and and perform new music out of quite unpredictable endeavors.
___

**Simon Duck**

{% include youtube.html youtube="vE5gyNw_wok" %}

How to design a keyboard that minimises performance anxiety? Simon came out with the MIDI uncontroller idea: a MIDI keyboard that decide everything for you. Exploiting randomness for almost all the keyboard parameters, the machine takes control away from the musician that can finally stop to care about stressful questions such as "what to play next?" or "how to play this?".

**Antonella Nonnis & Mei Zhang**

{% include youtube.html youtube="pKxsuP9u6pg" %}

The Patroniser is a wearable interface exploring troublesonic interactions. The goal is to put in an uncomfortable situation the performers that have to interact with the artefact. The e-textile design is made of a scrubbable and squeezable bra and a hat that can be played by patting on it.
___

**Andrew McPherson & Jacob Harrison**

{% include youtube.html youtube="MdphBOpZQMI" %}

Everyone Can Make Music condenses in one instrument all the most advanced music tech innovations that will ultimately democratise music practice. Finally now everyone can play music! It's easy, friendly and intuitive. Thanks to this instrument you will make outstanding music in five different styles!

**Juan Martinez Avila**

% include youtube.html youtube="PmX6MoUvGNE" %}

A seriously silly guitar strap: augmenting guitar using e-textile technique. A stretchable strap controlling the sound produced by the instrument. Subverting the ways we think about instruments and their attachments. When absurdity reveals the future of music technology.
___

**Alice Haynes**

{% include youtube.html youtube="VFug6PlRFX4" %}

Building music tech to be used in the depth of the ocean inspired by Narwhal whales. A sonic interface to be used in the depth of the ocean to communicate with friends and neighbors. When there is no light and no vision, a glimpse of uselessness might help us underwater..
