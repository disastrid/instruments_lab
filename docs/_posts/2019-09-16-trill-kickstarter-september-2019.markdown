In 2016, the Augmented Instruments Lab launched [Bela](http://bela.io), the open-source embedded platform for ultra-low-latency audio and sensor processing. 

Today, the Bela team has launched a new Kickstarter campaign for the [Trill sensors](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/423153472/trill-touch-sensing-for-makers), a set of versatile, easy-to-use touch sensors aimed at makers, artists and instrument builders. Trill will be live on Kickstarter for the next month, with three types of sensor available alongside experimenter kits featuring the Bela Mini.
