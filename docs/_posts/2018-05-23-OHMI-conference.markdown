Members of the augmented instruments lab will be contributing to the One-Handed Musical Instrument (OHMI) Trust's Conference and Awards event:

>On September 7th and 8th 2018, the OHMI Trust, in collaboration with Birmingham City University and Queen Mary University of London, will host a major conference exploring the barriers to music-making faced by people with physical disabilities. The event will also encompass the annual OHMI Competition awards.
The conference will bring together current multi-disciplinary research with, among others, the experiences of disabled musicians, teachers, charities, funders, and government agencies. Recently developed instrument designs will also be demonstrated.
The challenge to enable full and undifferentiated participation in music for people with physical disabilities is a subject only recently receiving attention. It is hoped that sharing knowledge through this conference will stimulate further and more rapid developments in the coming years.*
