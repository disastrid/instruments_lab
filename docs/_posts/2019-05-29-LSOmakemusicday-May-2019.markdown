Lab members Jacob Harrison and Luis Zayas were invited to show their instrument designs at the [LSO Make Music Day](https://lso.co.uk/whats-on/icalrepeat.detail/2019/05/29/1512/-/make-music-day.html), at LSO St. Lukes.
The LSO Make Music day was hosted by London Symphony Orchestra, and provides opportunities for young people with learning disabilities to try out different instruments and make some music with professional musicians from the LSO.
We were invited to show the Strummi, an accessible guitar instrument designed by Jacob, and the Granulator, a touch sensing granular synth instrument designed by Luis.
Also at the event were friends of the lab [Heart n Soul](http://www.heartnsoul.co.uk), who brought a suite of electronic instruments and devices to try out, as well as [The Sound Shirt](http://cutecircuit.com/soundshirt/), a wearable shirt fitted with micro-actuators that respond to audio input.
