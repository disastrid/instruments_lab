On the 21st March, Paul Stapleton from SARC, Queen's University Belfast will be visiting Queen Mary and giving a seminar.

##### Improvising Musicians Are Not Users: Observations from the design and study of performance ecosystems

The talk will focus on an ecosystemic approach (Bowers, Waters, et al.) to thinking, making and performing musical interactions between instruments, musicians and environments. This discussion will be informed by past and present observational studies conducted at SARC, as well as critical reflections on Paul's own design/performance practice including Ambiguous Devices (with Tom Davis) and VASBPI (with Maarten van Walstijn and Sandor Mehes). These observations will lead into a broader discussion of enskilment, stylistic diversity, control, unpredictability, as well as distributed agency and co-tuning in musician-instrument relationships.
