**Abstract**\
Iran Sanadzadeh reflects on the shape of an ongoing musical practice on a digital musical instrument, through the lens of her Floors. The Terpsichora pressure-sensitive Floors are wooden platforms with sensors, with which Iran performs electronic music. As an instrument, the Floors are designed to allow many possibilities using few sensors, and encourage focused movements of the whole body in performance. She has recently released a solo album on the instrument; Ocean, Again, (PEOPLE SOUND June 2023) explores perception shift and control of small sonic changes in electronic music using movement. This presentation of the album as an LP, acousmatic and static, reveals the sonic practice of this instrument outside of the visual metaphor, instilling the movement into the sound and removing the interface. In this session, Iran examines the development of the Floors and the practice around them; she outlines the process of reshaping a performance away from an instrument based on the internalised physical relationship developed with it, and the two-way development of traditions and designs. She suspects that with enough perspectives considered, recorded music can show the physical processes behind its making and at a glance, before it is used for sound, the depth of an electronic instrumentâ€™s world is possible to glimpse.
