The [RAW and The COOKED](https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/) is a two day ‘happening’ of new approaches to musical creation and creativity. Fostering an open source ethos to sharing and developing new (and existing) skills, the event brings together the best of today's pioneering musical movements. The Augmented Instruments lab joined the event with two performances and one talk and one workshop!  

---------------------

##### An Alien

A brand new music project from Andrea Guidi - live electronics performance

##### Lia Mice

Live electronics featuring custom designed instruments and live voice sampling: bringing new dimensions to the analog sampler live set.

##### Giacomo Lepri

Talk: exploring Media Archaeology practices for interactive art.

##### Bela workshop

Hands-on workshop introducing [Bela](http://bela.io/): an embedded maker platform for responsive audio and sensor processing.

The event is hosted by the [Media & Arts Technology](http://www.mat.qmul.ac.uk/) Centre for Doctoral Training at Queen Mary University of London. [Here](https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/cooked.html) more details on the Lab interventions during the second day of the event.
