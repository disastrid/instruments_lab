The Augmented Instruments Lab invite you to view [NIME 2022](http://nime2022.org) (28 June to 1 July) onsite with us at QMUL. As the conference is entirely virtual this year, we will be hosting colleagues and researchers for viewing, discussion, demos, and general in-person interaction during the conference period. The NIME programme runs from 12pm-12am (BST) each day. This a casual, free gathering open to anyone registered for the NIME conference. Please email us for details if you would like to attend.

As a lab we are thrilled to be presenting 6 papers (all available [here](/publications)):

* The M in NIME: Motivic analysis and the case for a musicology of NIME performances *(Lia Mice and Andrew McPherson)*
* Quantitative evaluation of aspects of embodiment in new digital musical instruments *(Andrea Guidi and Andrew McPherson)*
* Dialogic Design of Accessible Digital Musical Instruments: Investigating Performer Experience *(Eevee Zayas-Garin and Andrew McPherson)*
* Exploring Experiences with New Musical Instruments through Micro-phenomenology *(Courtney Reed, Charlotte Nordmoen, Andrea Martelloni, Giacomo Lepri, Nicole Robson, Eevee Zayas-Garin, Kelsey Cotton, Lia Mice and Andrew McPherson)*
* The 10,000 Instruments Workshop - (Im)practical Research for Critical Speculation *(Giacomo Lepri, John Bowers, Samantha Topley, Paul Stapleton, Peter Bennett, Kristina Andersen and Andrew McPherson)*
* Being With The Waves: An Ultrasonic Art Installation Enabling Rich Interaction Without Sensors *(Nicole Robson, Andrew McPherson and Nick Bryan-Kinns)*

Lab member Teresa Pelinski is leading the online workshop [Embedded AI for NIME: Challenges and Opportunities](https://embedded-ai-for-nime.github.io) which will be held on 28 June. *(Full organiser team: Teresa Pelinski, Victor Shepardson, Steve Symons, Franco S. Caspe, Adan L. Benito Temprano, Jack Armitage, Chris Kiefer, Rebecca Fiebrink, Thor Magnusson, and Andrew McPherson)*

We are looking forward to seeing friends and colleagues at NIME, either in person or online!
