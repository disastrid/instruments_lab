We invited the brilliant pianist and composer [Stefano Bollani](http://stefanobollani.com/en) to visit our lab. He answered the call! We spent a wonderful afternoon with him, showing our current projects (starting from the [MPR](http://instrumentslab.org/research/mrp.html) and [TouchKey](http://instrumentslab.org/research/touchkeys.html)). We received valuables feedback and support! We hope to welcome him back soon!
