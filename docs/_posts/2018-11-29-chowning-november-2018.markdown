Thanks to an invitation from [Elaine Chew](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~eniale/) we had the pleasure to welcome John Chowning and Maureen Chowning at Queen Mary. The visit included a [distinguished lecture](http://mupae.blogspot.com/2018/09/john-chowning-distinguished-lecture.html) followed by a [concert](http://mupae.blogspot.com/2018/09/john-chowning-concert-of-computer-music.html) on November 28th. The day after, we organised some presentations and demos of various C4DM research, including many projects from the Augmented Instrument Lab. It has been wonderful to meet Professor Chowning! A truly brilliant, emphatic and amusing person.
