We were very happy to host a visit from Heart n Soul's [SoundLab](https://www.heartnsoulsoundlab.com/) project.

[Heart n Soul](https://www.heartnsoul.co.uk/) are an award-winning creative arts company and charity that work with young people and adults with learning disabilities. The SoundLab project is an innovative digital music making project, with goal of exploring ways of using music technology to encourage people with learning disabilities to create music and sound experiences.

Lab member Jacob Harrison has been working with members of Heart n Soul as research collaborators on a project involving the use of Accessible Digital Musical Instruments in group music making sessions. You can read about the first part of this project in the Late-Breaking Work paper from CHI 2019 here: [download pdf](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3313037).

We can't wait to work with them more in the future. Watch this space!
