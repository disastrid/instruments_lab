On 14 February 2019, the lab hosted a visit by [Koray Tahiroglu](https://people.aalto.fi/koray.tahiroglu), Academy Research Fellow at Aalto University and leader of its [Sound and Physical Interaction](http://sopi.aalto.fi/) research group. Together we are investigating idiomatic patterns in the tools we use to design musical instruments, and how these patterns influence the design decisions we make.
