**Abstract**\
Ethically mindful development of creative-AI applications requires a broad understanding of the stakeholders involved, but we are still in the early days of mapping these uncertain terrains. In my talk, I will outline three recent studies on the stakeholders and ethics of creative-AI. First, we explored the material and conceptual framings of what it means to create art with AI tools in a series of interviews with Nordic AI-artists. I will deliver insight into our results, focusing on how artists describe their own motivations to adopt AI tools in their work. Secondly, critical case studies in music-AI tools, such as folk-rnn (Sturm et al. 2016) open perspectives to how heritage data use in AI training is entangled with questions of value and responsibility. Finally, I will introduce EASE, an analytical tool for ethical project evaluation and stakeholder elicitation for developers of creative-AI, and discuss our experiences with it in the context of music-AI applications.
