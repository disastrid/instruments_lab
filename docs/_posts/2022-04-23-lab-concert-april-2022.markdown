##### About the performances:

**Nwando Ebizie: Solve et Coagula**
[Nwando Ebizie](https://www.nwandoebizie.com) is a multidisciplinary artist whose work converges around performance art personas, experimental theatre, music and African diasporic ritualistic dance. At this concert, Nwando will perform Solve et Coagula – a 16 speaker surround audio performance created in residence as part of YSWN’s Sound Pioneers Programme. The piece is a ritual experience – an invitation to experience the psychic phenomena of breaking down the self in order to let go, pass through, remake oneself anew.

**Sophie Cooper: Intact**
[Sophie Cooper](http://sophiecoopermusic.com/) is a sound artist whose practice pivots around new presentations of acoustic instrumentation (primarily the trombone) with electronics, challenging conventions around composition, text placement and performance. Nominated for an Ivors sound art award in 2020, Sophie joins us at this concert to present ‘Intact’ a piece produced for hcmf// in 2019 for the Huddersfield Immersive Sound System.

**Julia Set: multi-channel performance**
[Julia Set](https://juliaset.bandcamp.com/) are an audiovisual project curated by Lewis Wolstanholme and Francis Devine. For this performance they will be performing a new work centred upon spatial deconstruction and the spatial interaction of colour. http://lewiswolstanholme.co.uk/videos

**Courtney Reed: voice augmented with singing knit**
[Courtney Reed](https://courtneynreed.wordpress.com/) is a mezzo-soprano and a PhD student at the Centre for Digital Music at QMUL. At this concert, Courtney’s semi-improvised surround performance will feature voice augmented with the Singing Knit, a knit collar for capturing the laryngeal muscle movements through surface electromyography.

**\_luiszayas: multi-channel meditative performance**
[Luis Zayas](https://spiritualadvisoruk.bandcamp.com/) is a composer, instrument designer and member of the Augmented Instruments Lab. Luis will be performing the software designed for their 2016 installation lifeSupport. It will be a meditative piece using sinetone oscillators tuned using just intonation and distributed around the room’s speaker array.

**Lia Mice: DJ**
[Lia Mice](https://www.liamice.com/) is a multidisciplinary artist, instrument designer and member of the Augmented Instruments Lab. At this concert, Lia will DJ music featuring AI and new digital instruments. www.liamice.com @lia_mice
