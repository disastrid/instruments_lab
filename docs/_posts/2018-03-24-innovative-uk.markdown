Augmented Instruments Ltd, the spinout company developing [Bela](http://bela.io), has a grant from Innovate UK entitled ***"Enabling Accessible, High-Performance Crafts for Makers and Artists"***. It is a yearlong project running from April 2018 with [Becky Stewart](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~rebeccas/) at QMUL as an academic partner. The project explores applications of Bela in e-textiles and paper circuits to help craftspeople develop rich and responsive interactive systems. During the project we will be creating new prototype hardware and running workshops targeting craft communities and education.
